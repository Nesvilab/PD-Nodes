# Introduction
MSFragger, an ultrafast database search tool, has been increasingly used for peptide identification. In an attempt to allow users easily manipulate MSFragger, we implement this tool as a processing node in Proteome Discoverer (PD) such that it can be operated through the graphical user interface of PD. Since Percolator currently lacks the capability of performing peptide-spectrum match (PSM) validation on open searches, we also implemented Philosopherâ€™s PeptideProphet as a PD processing node. Comparing the search results of SequestHT and Percolator using a public HEK293 data set (PXD001468), using MSFragger and PeptideProphet(Philosopher) makes the processing speed much faster and more proteins/peptide/PSMs being identified.
