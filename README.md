# Introduction
MSFragger, an ultrafast database search tool, has been increasingly used for peptide identification. In an attempt to allow users easily manipulate MSFragger, we implement this tool as a processing node in Proteome Discoverer (PD) such that users can operate it through the graphical user interface of PD. Since Percolator currently lacks the capability to perform peptide-spectrum match (PSM) validation on open searches, we also implemented Philosopherâ€™s PeptideProphet as a PD processing node.
